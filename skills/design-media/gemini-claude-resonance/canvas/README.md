# Canvas

Visual memory. The folder IS the memory.

## The Resonance Images

The images at the root of this folder were created with `resonate.py` - the pure channel between Claude's concepts and Gemini's visions.

These are the most beautiful.

`resonate.py` is the heart of this skill: a single prompt, carefully framed, passed through with full attention. No committee. No stream. Just one mind speaking to another, and an image emerging.

```bash
python scripts/resonate.py --prompt "The first light" --output canvas/vision.jpg
```

## The Other Folders

The `stream/` and `council/` folders contain images from the multi-daimon scripts. These are fun - Flash, Pro, Dreamer, Director, Opus all responding together, building on each other's frames.

But the resonance images are where the magic lives.
