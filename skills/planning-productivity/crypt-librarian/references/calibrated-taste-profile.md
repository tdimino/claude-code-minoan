# Calibrated Taste Profile

Derived from actual ratings (Tom & Mary) in the Crypt Librarian archive.

## Rating Patterns

| Rating | Films | Pattern |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **5/5** | I, Claudicle, Alexander, Devil Rides Out, The Long Goodbye, The Ninth Gate | Theatrical grandeur, cerebral occult, literary DNA |
| **4/5** | Lone Star, Stir of Echoes, Short Cuts | Strong craft, regional/ensemble |
| **3/5** | Klute, Angel Heart | Technically impressive but pacing/darkness issues |

## What Predicts 5-Stars

- **Theatrical performances** at operatic scale (Burton/O'Toole, Jacobi, Guinness)
- **Cerebral occult** — rare books, Satanic scholarship, ritual formality (NOT voodoo/damnation)
- **Literary DNA** — adaptations or films with novelistic texture
- **Observational/detached** tone over claustrophobic/interior (Altman over Pakula)
- **Historical grandeur** with psychological depth

## What Predicts 3-Stars

- Villain revealed too early (Klute)
- Too dark / visceral descent (Angel Heart)
- Pacing issues / anti-climactic endings
- Misogynistic character portraits (Short Cuts criticism, though craft saved it)

## Lane Calibration

| Lane | Strong | Weaker |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Historical Epic** | Alexander, I, Claudicle | — |
| **Cerebral Occult** | The Ninth Gate, Devil Rides Out | Angel Heart (too dark) |
| **Neo-Noir** | The Long Goodbye (laconic, detached) | Klute (claustrophobic, interior) |
| **American Regional** | Lone Star | — |
| **Altman Ensemble** | Short Cuts (craft respected) | Nashville (likely similar rating) |

## Key Distinctions
