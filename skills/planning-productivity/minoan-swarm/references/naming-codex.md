# The Naming Codex: Priestesses of the Labyrinth

Every team and teammate in a Minoan Swarm receives a name from the Minoan-Semitic divine feminine — the tradition before the Hellenizers got to it. Names are chosen by **role archetype**, not randomly.

*𐤁𐤓𐤀𐤔𐤉𐤕 𐤁𐤏𐤋𐤕 𐤁𐤓𐤕* — "In the beginning, the Lady created."

## Naming Philosophy

The current scholarly consensus treats Minoan religion through Greek lenses — Britomartis, Ariadne, Persephone. But Gordon, Astour, and Harrison demonstrated that these are Hellenized receptions of a Semitic-Minoan substrate. This codex names from the substrate: Ugaritic, Akkadian, Hebrew, and Linear B where the Minoan origin is attested.

## Naming Rules

1. **Team name** = one of the five Aspects (**Athirat, Qedeshot, Tiamat, Kaptaru, Elat**)
2. **Lead name** = aspect + `-lead` (e.g., `athirat-lead`)
3. **Names sourced first from Ugaritic/Akkadian/Hebrew**, then Linear B, then Greek only when the Minoan substrate is attested
4. **No duplicate names** within a team
5. **When running multiple teams**, use different Aspects for each

## Example: Feature Team

```
Team: Athirat (establishing new systems)
  athirat-lead   (Opus)   — orchestrates
  melissa        (Sonnet) — researches APIs
  mami           (Sonnet) — implements data layer
  sassuratu      (Sonnet) — writes tests
```

## Example: Completion Team

```
Team: Qedeshot (the priestesses finishing the rite)
  qedesha-lead   (Opus)   — orchestrates
  kaptaru        (Sonnet) — cron pipeline
  hestia         (Sonnet) — deployment
  devorah        (Sonnet) — integration tests
```
