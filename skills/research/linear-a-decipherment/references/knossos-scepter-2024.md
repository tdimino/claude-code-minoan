## Inscription: KN Zg 57 (Ring) — ~119 signs total

### Face A (top, sloped)
- **Left half**: 12 quadruped animals, each in own metope (facing left)
- **Right half**: ~18 signs (16 preserved + 2 estimated)
  - At least 10 vases (6 amphora-type)
  - Vases with syllabic signs in ligature: vas+PA, vas+RU, etc.
  - Rhyton (A 664) and tripod have NO associated syllabogram
  - Syllabograms may specify vase types or contents

### Face B (bottom, flat)
- 6 well-preserved sign groups + 3 logograms
- Logograms: GRA (grain), probably FAR, probably OLIV
- Each logogram in its own metope
- **No numerals or fractional signs**
- Direction: left-to-right (judged by AB 81 KU, AB 40 WI, AB 60 RA)

### Face C (external circumference)
- At least 9 sign groups + 5 textile logograms
- Textiles differ by number of fringes
- One textile sign ligatured with AB 77 (KA)
- **~40% surface damage**, many signs lost
- Direction: left-to-right

### Face D (internal circumference)
- ~9 hide signs (AB 180), extremely damaged
- One possible ligature with AB 77 (KA), AB 78 (QE), or AB 70 (KO)

### Sign Count
- ~84 completely or partially preserved
- ~35 in traces or estimated from available space
- **Total: ~119 signs**

### Key Characteristics
- **No numerals** on any face (unlike administrative tablets)
- Metope arrangement (vertical lines frame each sign/group)
- Calligraphic, near-3D quality unique in Linear A corpus
- "Few parallels of the sign-groups on the Ring with sign-groups on extant Linear A texts"
- Iconography and writing integrated into a single narrative
- Parallels: stone libation table IO Za 2; painted cups KN Zc 6, KN Zc 7; Phaistos Disk (metope arrangement)

## Inscription: KN Zg 58 (Handle) — Administrative text

### Faces α–δ
- **Face α**: 2 vases with ligatured signs + sign for 10 + probable new sign + Hieroglyphic *180 and *181
- **Face β**: 4-sign sequence (right end) + probable animal hide sign (left)
- **Face γ**: Boar + probable pig, no numerals
- **Face δ**: 2 vases with ligatured signs + units + **6 fractional signs in sequence**

### Key Characteristics
- Administrative text with numerals and fractions
- Contains Hieroglyphic signs *180 and *181 — **first attestation in Linear A**
- The fractional sequence provides relative values, **contradicting previous proposals**
- Different ductus from ring: linearized AB 08 (A), different orientation of AB 77 (KA) internal strokes
- Sign ligature order reversed vs ring: on ring A is above KA; on handle A is below KA

## Signs Attested (from preliminary publication)

| Sign | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| AB 08 | A | Different forms on ring vs handle (two scribes) |
| AB 81 | KU | Used for direction determination |
| AB 40 | WI | Used for direction determination |
| AB 60 | RA | Compared to silver pin KN Zf 31 |
| AB 07 | DI | Occurs multiple times on ring |
| AB 77 | KA | Ligatured with textile sign on Face C |
| AB 01 | TA | Used for direction determination on Face C |
| AB 24 | NE | Compared to silver pin KN Zf 31 |
| AB 09 | SE | Compared to silver pin KN Zf 31 |
| AB 28 | I | Compared to silver pin KN Zf 31 |
| A 664 | Rhyton | Only attestation in Linear A (PH 8a.3) |
| *180 | (Hieroglyphic) | First use in Linear A (on handle) |
| *181 | (Hieroglyphic) | First use in Linear A (on handle) |

## Significance for Decipherment

1. **Longest Linear A inscription** — surpasses HT 123 (105 signs, but ~60 phonetic)
2. **Non-administrative context** — no numerals on ring; ritual/ceremonial use
3. **Novel sign groups** — few parallels with existing corpus = potential new vocabulary
4. **Integrated iconography** — writing and image serve a single narrative
5. **Two scribes** — different hands on ring vs handle, possibly different times
6. **Hieroglyphic signs in Linear A** — *180, *181 demonstrate cross-script continuity
7. **Fractional system revision** — handle's fraction sequence challenges existing models
8. **Calligraphic quality** — closest to Cretan Hieroglyphic style; unique in Linear A

## Status for Digital Corpus

**Not yet in GORILA or any digital corpus.**

Full sign-by-sign transliteration is reserved for the forthcoming monograph:
- Kanta, A. (ed.) forthcoming. *Anetaki II: the Neopalatial Room 1 and the Ivory Repository.*

When the full transliteration is published, it should be:
1. Added to `LinearAInscriptions.js` as KN Zg 57 and KN Zg 58
2. Run through the full cognate search pipeline
3. The ring's sign groups (Face B) are the most promising for Semitic analysis
   (GRA, FAR, OLIV logograms suggest agricultural/ritual accounting)
