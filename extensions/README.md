# VS Code Extensions (`extensions/`)

Custom VS Code extensions that integrate with the Claude Code ecosystem.

## Claude Session Tracker

Track and resume Claude Code sessions across crashes, restarts, and multiple VS Code windows.

### Features

- **Cross-Window Tracking** — See total Claude sessions across ALL VS Code windows (e.g., "Claude Active (7)")
- **Session Browser** — TreeView in Explorer sidebar with AI-generated titles, model name, turn count, and cost
- **Crash Recovery** — Detects crashed sessions and offers one-click resume
- **Quick Resume** — `Cmd+Shift+C` to instantly resume your last session
- **Session Picker** — Browse and resume from recent sessions with enriched metadata
- **Auto-Refresh** — FileSystemWatchers update the TreeView when session data changes
- **Multi-Root Support** — Tracks sessions for all workspace folders

### Installation

```bash
cd extensions/claude-session-tracker
npm install
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies
code --install-extension claude-session-tracker-*.vsix
```

### Keybindings

| Command | Keybinding | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Resume Last Session | `Cmd+Shift+C` | Resume most recent Claude session |
| Pick Session | — | Browse and select from recent sessions |
| Browse All Sessions | — | Browse sessions across ALL projects |

### Architecture

The extension consumes two data sources produced by the CLI tools:

- `sessions-index.json` — Session metadata (timestamps, project paths)
- `session-summaries.json` — AI-generated titles, model info, turn counts, costs

Both are generated by `claude-tracker` and `claude-tracker-search` (see `bin/README.md`).

### Version History
