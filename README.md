# Figma (HTTP)
claude mcp add figma --http "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp" -s user
```

## Recommended Workflow Commands

These are the most powerful commands for professional development workflows:

### `/requirements-start` Series - Extensive Project Planning

**Use when**: Starting any new feature or project that needs careful planning

The requirements workflow creates comprehensive specifications through structured discovery:

1. **`/requirements-start <description>`** - Initiates requirements gathering
   - Asks 5 high-level yes/no questions to understand scope
   - Analyzes codebase context and existing patterns
   - Generates 5 detailed technical questions
   - Creates comprehensive specification document

2. **`/requirements-continue`** - Resume interrupted requirements session
3. **`/requirements-review`** - Review and refine existing requirements
4. **`/requirements-implement`** - Begin implementation from specification

**Why it's powerful**:
- Prevents scope creep through structured discovery
- Documents decisions for future reference
- Catches architectural conflicts early
- Creates implementation-ready specifications
- Saves hours of refactoring later

**Example workflow**:
```bash
/requirements-start Implement user authentication with OAuth
# Answer discovery questions
# Answer technical questions
# Review specification
/requirements-implement
```

### `/workflows:review` - Comprehensive Code Review

**Use when**: Before committing significant changes or reviewing pull requests

> **Note**: This command is token-intensive due to parallel subagents. Use for thorough reviews; for quick checks, use `/code-review`.

Analyzes code for:
- Security vulnerabilities (credential exposure, input validation)
- Performance bottlenecks (inefficient patterns, memory leaks)
- Code quality (complexity, maintainability, best practices)
- Architecture issues (layer separation, dependency direction)

Creates prioritized issues with:
- Exact file locations and line numbers
- Problem explanation and impact assessment
- Specific remediation steps
- Severity and effort estimates

**Why it's powerful**:
- Uses 12+ specialized parallel subagents (security-sentinel, performance-oracle, architecture-strategist, etc.)
- Catches issues before they reach production
- Provides actionable feedback, not just complaints
- Creates GitHub issues automatically if requested

### `feature-dev` Plugin - Claude Code Team's Arsenal

**Use when**: Building features, exploring codebases, or reviewing code with specialized agents

The `feature-dev` plugin is the **official Claude Code team's toolkit** - the same agents they use internally. Install it with:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
/plugin install feature-dev
```

**Available agents** (invoke via Task tool with `subagent_type`):

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `feature-dev:code-architect` | Designs feature architectures by analyzing existing patterns, providing implementation blueprints with specific files, component designs, data flows, and build sequences |
| `feature-dev:code-explorer` | Deeply analyzes codebase features by tracing execution paths, mapping architecture layers, understanding patterns/abstractions, and documenting dependencies |
| `feature-dev:code-reviewer` | Reviews code for bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues using confidence-based filtering to surface only high-priority findings |

**Why it's powerful**:
- Built by the Claude Code team for their own workflows
- Specialized agents outperform general-purpose prompts
- `code-architect` creates comprehensive blueprints before you write code
- `code-explorer` maps unfamiliar codebases quickly
- `code-reviewer` catches issues with confidence-based prioritization

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# Explore an unfamiliar codebase
# (Claude uses feature-dev:code-explorer agent)
"How does the authentication system work in this codebase?"

# Design a new feature
# (Claude uses feature-dev:code-architect agent)
"Design the architecture for adding OAuth support"

# Review your changes
# (Claude uses feature-dev:code-reviewer agent)
"Review my recent changes for any issues"
```

### `codex-orchestrator` Skill - Delegate to Specialized Codex Subagents

**Use when**: You need focused code review, debugging, architecture analysis, security audits, or documentation from Codex CLI

The codex-orchestrator skill lets Claude delegate tasks to OpenAI's Codex CLI with specialized AGENTS.md personas. Each profile shapes the agent's behavior for a specific task type.

**Available profiles**:

| Profile | Purpose | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `reviewer` | Code quality, bugs, performance | Pre-commit review, PR assessment |
| `debugger` | Root cause analysis, fixes | Investigating bugs, tracing issues |
| `architect` | System design, component boundaries | Planning changes, evaluating architecture |
| `security` | OWASP, vulnerabilities, secrets | Security audits, compliance checks |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup, modernization | Reducing tech debt, improving structure |
| `docs` | API docs, READMEs, comments | Documentation tasks |

**Quick execution**:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh reviewer "Review src/auth.ts for security issues"
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh debugger "Debug the login timeout on slow networks"
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh architect "Design a caching layer for the API"
```

**Why it's powerful**:
- Each profile has deep expertise in its domain
- AGENTS.md persona injection guides Codex behavior
- Supports chaining patterns (review → debug → fix)
- Works with codex-mini, o3, o4-mini models
- Full-auto mode for unattended execution

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Find issues
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh reviewer "Review src/api/ for bugs"

# 2. Investigate specific bug
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh debugger "Debug the race condition found in cache.ts"

# 3. Design fix approach
~/.claude/skills/codex-orchestrator/scripts/codex-exec.sh architect "Design fix for the cache race condition"
```

### `super-ralph-wiggum` Skill - Autonomous Iteration Loops

**Use when**: Running Claude Code in autonomous loops for bulk tasks like test coverage, lint fixing, code cleanup, or PRD-based feature development

Based on [AI Hero's 11 Tips](https://www.aihero.dev/tips-for-ai-coding-with-ralph-wiggum), this skill runs the same prompt repeatedly until task completion, with context persisting through files and git history.

**Available templates**:

| Template | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `test-coverage` | Improve test coverage to target % |
| `feature-prd` | Implement features from PRD file |
| `lint-fix` | Fix lint errors incrementally |
| `entropy-loop` | Remove dead code, smells, TODOs |
| `duplication-loop` | Extract duplicate code into utilities |

**Quick usage**:
```
Run super-ralph-wiggum with test-coverage template, max 20 iterations
Run super-ralph-wiggum with feature-prd template using ./prd.json
```

**Why it's powerful**:
- The agent chooses tasks from your PRD, not you
- HITL mode for learning, AFK mode for overnight runs
- Progress file persists learning across iterations
- Docker sandbox support for safe unattended execution
- "Fight entropy" and quality-first principles built in

### `/audit-plans` - Plan Completeness Auditing

**Use when**: Before implementing a plan to ensure nothing is missed

Systematically audits implementation plans:
- Reads phases chronologically
- Evaluates against completeness criteria (acceptance criteria, implementation steps, dependencies, edge cases)
- Invokes `/interview` to fill gaps with structured questions
- Updates plan and related documentation

## MCP Servers

> **Note: We've shifted away from heavy MCP usage.** Claude Code now includes [MCP Tool Search](https://www.atcyrus.com/stories/mcp-tool-search-claude-code-context-pollution-guide), which loads tools on-demand rather than all upfront—reducing context pollution by ~85%. This means large MCP setups no longer exhaust the context window. However, we've found that **skills often provide better ergonomics** than MCPs for most workflows, with clearer documentation and simpler invocation patterns. The MCPs below are kept for reference but are not actively maintained.

### Configured in `.mcp.json`

|--------|------|---------|
| **supabase** | stdio | PostgreSQL database operations |
| **netlify** | stdio | Deployment and site management |
| **playwright** | stdio | Browser automation and testing |
| **context7** | HTTP | Up-to-date library documentation |
| **shadcn** | HTTP | shadcn/ui component library |
| **figma** | HTTP | Figma design integration |
| **arxiv** | stdio | Academic paper search and analysis |

### 5. Markdown Editor Settings (Workspace)

This repo includes `.vscode/settings.json` with optimized Markdown editing:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `editor.wordWrap` | on | Wrap long lines instead of horizontal scrolling |
| `editor.lineHeight` | 1.4 | More breathing room between lines |
| `editor.fontSize` | 13 | Comfortable reading size |
| `editor.minimap.enabled` | true | Show minimap for quick file navigation |

**Markdown Preview** (Cmd+K V):
- Synced scrolling between editor and preview
- 1.5x line spacing for readability
- Cursor position highlighted in preview

**Syntax Highlighting**:
- Headings: Blue (`#58A6FF`)
- Lists: Light cyan (`#7DD3FC`)
- Links: Blue with underline
- Code: Light gray (`#c9d1d9`)

These settings apply automatically when opening this repo in VS Code.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** - Use placeholders in `.mcp.json`
2. **Use environment variables** - Store secrets in `.env` files
3. **Git ignore sensitive files**:
   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   *_local.json
   ```
4. **Rotate keys regularly** - Especially for shared team accounts
5. **Use scoped tokens** - Minimum permissions required

   argument-hint: [required-arg] [optional-arg]
   ---
   Your prompt template here
   ```
3. Document expected inputs/outputs
4. Include examples in comments

### MCP Server Guidelines

1. Test server thoroughly before adding
2. Document all required environment variables
3. Include troubleshooting steps
4. Note any system dependencies
5. Specify which scope (user/project/local) is recommended
